--Building/Programming Programs--
To build a project, run command from cc430bsn directory
'make projectname'
or
'make clean projectname'

Programming via the rf2500 dongle is also a makefile feature called by
'make program'

An example of a complete all-in-one command is
'make clean projectname ADDRESS=0x05 program'


--Makefile Configuration--
Each project is located in its own folder inside the cc430bsn directory. Inside each projects directory, a file, usually called projectname.mk contains makefile commands/definitions specific to that project.

The Makefile in the cc430bsn directory contains all common and library definitions and includes all of the *.mk files from subdirectories.


--Useful References--
